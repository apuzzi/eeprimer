## Earth Engine Primer  

These are materials that I have developed for teaching with Google Earth Engine at a small, undergraduate, liberal arts college in Vermont, USA.  

The [table of contents](toc.md) shows the sequence that I use in an introductory geography course ([Geography 150: Mapping global environmental change](https://geog0150.github.io/s22/)).  

The [Glossary](glossary.md) defines and illustrates key terms.  

This is a work in progress and updated regularly.    

_Please note: I keep test problems in private repositories. Please contact me if you are an instructor who would like access to them._
