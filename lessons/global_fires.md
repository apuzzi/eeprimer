## Global fires  

In this lesson, we work with a global dataset of fires recorded each day for the last twenty years and compare this big picture view with a method for producing high resolution maps of burn intensity using the [**Normalized Burn Ratio**](https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-burn-severity/in-detail/normalized-burn-ratio). We estimate the change in NBR and classify levels of fire severity following a large fire on the slow coast of California. We then add a legend to the map that defines our burn severity classes.

I made this app to help a friend access maps about burn intensities near Davenport, CA. Because of some of my coding decisions, this app only lets the user explore fires in one year in one state of the USA.

### Global fire explorer

My goal here is to get closer to building something that helps people examine fires anywhere in the world and connect global patterns and histories of fire to local scale details of burn severity, timing, and recurrence.
