Read at least 5 stories in [NASA's Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/). In the lot you read, please identify the story:  

* with a topic that interests you,
* that uses a dataset available in the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets).

Then try to describe the dataset in the Earth Engine data catalog for any of relevant characteristic listed below.

spatial  
: what pixel scale/resolution of bands?  
: what is the regional extent of the collection  

temporal
: when did mission start and end (temporal extent)?  
: how often do you get a picture (recurrence interval)?  
: what time of day is the picture?  
: how long does it take for the picture to get into the earth engine data catalog (latency)?  

spectral  
: how many bands does the image of?  
:how do bands parse the spectrum?  

processing  
: is the collection single images or mosaics?
: are the data raw or processed (products)?
: what were the criteria for processing?
