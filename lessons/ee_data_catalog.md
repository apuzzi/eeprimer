## Survey of remote sensing datasets    

In this lesson, we survey remote sensing datasets that are accessible through [Earth Engine's public data archive](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets). You learn and apply basic criteria to describe and compare these datasets and explore the starter scripts provided by Google to load, filter, and visualize these datasets.

### Describing remote sensing datasets  

Here are some basic criteria to compare satellite platforms:  
* Spatial characteristics  
    * pixel scale/resolution  
    * extent
* Temporal characteristics
    * mission start and end  
    * return interval (recurrence)  
    * time of day
* Spectral characteristics  
    * number of bands  
    * range of bands  
* Processing characteristics  
    * single image/mosaic  
    * raw data/processed data
