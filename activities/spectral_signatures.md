## Spectral signature scavenger hunt    

This activity introduces you to remote sensing, EMR, and spectral signatures.  

### Spectral signature app   

I wrote [this earth engine app](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/spectral-signatures) to help you explore spectral signatures with Sentinel 2 images.    

You can use the app to:   

1. Pan map to a place you would like to explore.  

    - Click, hold, and drag map to pan.  
    - Click + or - to zoom in or out.  


2. Add a S2 image to the map.

    - Click DRAW S2 scene at map center.  


3. Change the date range filter for the image.  

    - This will let you change the season or year of the image that you add to the map.  
    - Check the _Define start and end dates_ box.  
    - Enter a start and end date to define a time window.   
    - You must use YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - Try to use two month windows.  
    - Click the _DRAW S2 scene at map center_ button to apply your date filter.
    - If the layer panel on the map turns red, try changing the date window and click the _DRAW_ button again.  


4. Plot spectral signature at one or more sample points for each land cover type.  

    - Check the _Explore spectral signatures_ box.  
    - Click a location on the map to chart the spectral signature of that location based on date in the S2 image.  
    - You can click more than one location to add multiple signatures to the chart.  
    - Click _Clear chart and samples_ to, well, to do that.  
    - If you get a chart error, clear the chart and try again.  


5. Download the spectral signature chart as a .png.        

    - Click the little gray icon in the upper right corner to open the chart in a new browser tab.  
    - Click the _Download PNG_ to download the chart as an image to your Google drive.

### Key terms

Here are some concepts that should help you understand what the app helps you see.   

- [Remote sensing systems](../glossary.md#remote-sensing-systems)    
- [Reflectance](../glossary.md#reflectance)   
- [Electromagnetic radiation](../glossary.md#electromagnetic-radiation-EMR)    
- [Wavelength](../glossary.md#wavelength)
- [Electromagnetic spectrum](../glossary.md#electromagnetic-spectrum)  
- [Spectral signatures](../glossary.md#spectral-signatures)
- [Sentinel 2](../glossary.md#sentinel-2)  

### Spectral signature scavenger hunt      

Please use the app to create charts that compare the spectral signatures of the following pairs of land cover types:  

1. Artificial playing fields versus natural playing fields
2. Conifers versus deciduous with leaves on  
3. Conifers versus deciduous with leaves off
4. Irrigated fields versus bare fields  
5. Silty water versus clear water  
6. Rainforest with trees versus rainforest cleared for agriculture  
7. Snow versus rock  

For each pair, please sample two points for each land cover type. So your chart should have four lines total. The lines should be similar for the two sample points of a single land cover type. But the lines should be different between the two land cover types.  

You will work in small groups. Each member of the group should create their own chart for each pair described above. Group members should show each other their charts. Then each group member should use this [Google form](https://forms.gle/QYYzrARLgsLnkpey5) to submit each chart (7 total). Please talk to each other about your responses to the form prompts as you submit your work.   

Thank you!
