## Spectral signature scavenger hunt    

This activity introduces you to remote sensing, EMR, and spectral signatures.

## Background

#### Remote sensing systems

#### Reflectance  

The ratio of the amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking the target.  

#### Electromagnetic radiation (EMR)    

Energy transfer mechanism between two points. Can be described as waves.

#### Wavelength

## Spectral signature app   

I wrote [this earth engine app](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/spectral-signatures) to help you explore spectral signatures with Sentinel 2 images.  

You can use the app to:   

1. Pan map to a place you would like to explore.   
2. Add a S2 image to the map.    
3. Change the date range filter for the image.     
4. Plot spectral signature at one or more sample points for each land cover type.  
5. Download the spectral signature chart as a .png.        

#### Sentinel 2 background  

[Copernicus Sentinel 2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) is a mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). The MultiSpectral Instrument aboard these two satellites measures reflectance with 13 bands.

## Spectral signature scavenger hunt      

Please use the app to create charts that compare the spectral signatures of the following pairs of land cover types:  

1. Artificial playing fields versus natural playing fields
2. Conifers versus deciduous with leaves on  
3. Conifers versus deciduous with leaves off
4. Irrigated fields versus bare fields  
5. Silty water versus clear water  
6. Rainforest with trees versus rainforest cleared for agriculture  
7. Snow versus rock  

For each pair, please sample two points for each land cover type. So your chart should have four lines total. The lines should be similar for the two sample points of a single land cover type. But the lines should be different between the two land cover types.  

You will work in small groups. Each member of the group should create their own chart for each pair described above. Group members should show each other their charts. Then each group member should use this [Google form](https://forms.gle/QYYzrARLgsLnkpey5) to submit each chart (7 total). Please talk to each other about your responses to the form prompts as you submit your work.   

Thank you!
