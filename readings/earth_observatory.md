### Earth Observatory readings   

_Due Jan 18 by 10am_

In the first week, we began to learn techniques for working with the Map UI, vector data (points, lineStrings, polygons), and raster data (image collections, images, bands) in Earth Engine. In the second week, while we continue to learn more technical skills, I would like you to begin to explore how these techniques can be applied to describe environmental conditions and changes across the planet.  

Please explore [NASA's Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/), a collection of images and stories about the planet based on observations we can make with sensors mounted to satellites.  

A good place to start is the [Articles](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features) page. Notice that the stories have __tags__ that categorize them by topic.  

After you have explored this collection of stories a little, please read __at least five (5) stories__ that especially stimulate your interest.   

For each story, please complete this [short Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddE2-GTBltnP10nH-r7OAaUaHW6sSpHSx6DujPDoeUFj46jQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to record:  

1. a url to the story,
2. a short description (50 - 150 words) about why you selected the story to read (so that I can better understand your personal interests in geography and the environment),
3. a description of the study type used in the story, based on the table below (copied from the syllabus).  


| STUDY TYPE | Region | Time period | Thematic layer |  
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:
| Compare same theme at same time period across two or more different regions | &ne; | = | = |
| Compare same region and same theme at two or more different time periods | = | &ne; | = |
| Compare two or more different themes at same region and same time period | = | = | &ne; |  

_Thank you. Please email me if you have any questions._
