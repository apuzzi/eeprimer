### Week two reading and reflection task   

_Due Jan 19 in class_

Please read __at least ten (10) stories__ in [NASA's Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) that pique your interest.   

Please make a list of the lot that you read with links to each story.   

From this list, please select __three (3) stories__ that:  

1. especially interest you because of their topical subject, methodology, or regional subject:  
<br>

2. __AND__ use a dataset that is available in the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets).



Then try to describe the dataset in the Earth Engine data catalog for all relevant characteristics listed below.  

_Please just use the descriptions in the data catalog, including the links, to try to answer the prompts below. If you can not find the info with the sources in the data catalog, please just make a note of that._  

__Spatial__  
What are the bands' pixel scale/resolution?  
What is the regional extent of the collection?  

__Temporal__  
When did the mission start and end (temporal extent)?  
How often do you get a picture of a place (recurrence interval)?  
What time of day is the picture?  
How long does it take for the picture to get into the earth engine data catalog (latency)?  

__Attributes__  
How many bands does the image contain?  
If the bands are spectral, how do they parse the spectrum?  
If the bands are not spectral, what earth attributes do they describe and how are these descriptions produced?    

__Processing history__  
Does the collection contain single images or mosaics?  
Are the data raw or processed?  
If processed, what were the criteria?  

#### Deliverable  

Google doc or markdown file (no microsoft word please) with:

1. a list of EO stories you read (with their links);
2. a list of characteristics for Earth Engine datasets from three stories.
