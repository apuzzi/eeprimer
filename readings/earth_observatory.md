## Earth Observatory readings   

Please explore [NASA's Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/), a collection of images and stories about the planet based on observations we can make with sensors mounted to satellites.  

You can find images about particular places in the world with [this interactive map](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/map#2/0.0/0.0). Spend a few minutes exploring images for a place that interests you so that you can get a sense for the kinds of subjects that can be investigated with satellite imagery.   

After exploring images for a place, please move to the [Articles](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features) page. Notice that the stories have __tags__ that categorize them by topic.  

Explore this collection of stories a little and then please read __at least five (5) stories__ that use satellite imagery as evidence and especially stimulate your interest.   

For each article, please complete this [short Google form](https://forms.gle/BWhYNidA3Bz5G71X7) to record:  

1. a url to the story,
2. a short description (50 - 150 words) about why you selected the story to read (so that I can better understand your personal interests in geography and the environment),
3. the satellite or data source for the imagery,
4. a description of the study type used in the story, based on the table below (copied from the syllabus).  


| STUDY TYPE | Region | Time period | Thematic layer |  
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:
| Compare same theme at same time period across two or more different regions | &ne; | = | = |
| Compare same region and same theme at two or more different time periods | = | &ne; | = |
| Compare two or more different themes at same region and same time period | = | = | &ne; |
